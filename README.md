Home-developed scripts: https://github.com/zhuozhizheng/Periventricular-diffusion-gradient-of-NAWM. 

Example data inlcuding image, gene and clinical information were also upload onto github: https://github.com/zhuozhizheng/Periventricular-diffusion-gradient-of-NAWM.

The lesion segmentation and lesion filling for T1w images could be found in LST manumal. 

The image brain tissue segmentation of T1 images could be found in the Cat12 manumal. 

The diffusion data processing, NODDI parameter fitting and normalization into MNI space could be found in file “Diffusion_image_processing_and_NODDI_metric_calculation”

The venrticular mask for population and individals could be found in file “Ventricular_mask_creation”.

The definition of periventricular map and ring, the NDI and ODI extraction of NAWM rings could be found in file “Periventricular_ ring_map_and_value_extraction”. 

Main statistical analysis using linear mixed model and linear regresion to explore the clinical assocaitons of the gradient could be found in file ‘Statistical_analysis’.

The Partial Least Squares and CNS celltype enrichment analysis as well as disease_GWAS_gene overlaps could be found in file “Statistical_analysis” 

Additional important figure plot scripts could be fould in file “figure_plot”. 

Example data inlcuding image, gene and clinical information could be found in file “data”.

All the shell scripts were tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.2. Matlab scripts were tested on Matlab 2019a on windows 10 system. R scripts were tested on Rstudio 2022.02.2 on windows 10 system.
